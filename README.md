# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for a Linux environment, managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). This repository is organized to allow for easy installation and management of configurations for each application.

### Repository Structure

This repository is structured for use with `stow`. Each top-level directory (e.g., `nvim`, `zellij`) is considered a separate package.

~/Dotfiles/
├── nvim/
│   └── .config/
│       └── nvim/
│           └── ... (your nvim files)
└── zellij/
    └── .config/
        └── zellij/
            └── ... (your zellij files)


### Prerequisites

You need the following tools installed on your system to use these dotfiles:

-   `git`: For cloning this repository.
-   `stow`: To manage the symbolic links.

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the dotfiles on your system. This will create symbolic links from this repository to the correct locations in your home directory (`~`).

1.  **Clone the repository** into your home directory:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[rainingmp3]/Dotfiles.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the repository** and run `stow` for each package you want to install:
    ```sh
    cd Dotfiles
    stow nvim
    stow alacritty
    # stow zellij
    ```
    *Note: The `stow` command is run from inside the `Dotfiles` directory. It automatically creates the symbolic links in your home directory (`~`).*

### Usage and Management

-   **To update your dotfiles**: If you make changes, pull the latest version from GitHub, and then run `stow -R` to restow the packages.
    ```sh
    cd ~/Dotfiles
    git pull
    stow -R nvim
    ```
-   **To uninstall a package**: Use the `-D` flag to delete the symbolic links.
    ```sh
    cd ~/Dotfiles
    stow -D nvim
    ```
